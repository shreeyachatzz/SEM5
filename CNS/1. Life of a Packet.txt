Life of a Packet:

OSI Model: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link Layer, Physical Layer
TCP/IP Model: Application Layer(First 3), Transport Layer, Internet Layer(instead of network Layer), Network Access Layer( Last 2)

Application Layer:
FQDN- Fully Qualified Domain Name
PDU- Protocol Data Unit
ISP- Internet Service Provider

Application Layer: Payload (www.google.com)

Transport Layer: Segment+ Destination PortNo.(Fixed) + Source Port number(random)
Port Number is a special number assigned to a particular service running at a particular identification number.
Port number: 16bit

Name	| Port No.
___________________
HTTPS	|  443
HTTP	|  80
FTP	|  21-20
SMTP	|  25
SSH	|  22
TELNET	|  23

NETWORK LAYER/ INTERNET LAYER: Protocol-(Packet+Src IP+ Dest. IP)
The IP addess is given by the DNS
IP Adress: 32bit (dotted decimal notation)

DATA LINK LAYER: Src MAC+ Frame+ Dest. MAC
MAC add: 48 bit (hex notation)

The frame is changed to bits which travel to other places.

Gateway-> Router: the number of gateways is the number of hops 
Command to check: <<tracert www.google.com>>
tracert sends 3 packets to check the time taken to reach each hop.
To check IP detail: IP Lookup
First hop is to the ISP.

To check your IP: www.whatismyip.com

Maximum number of Hops that can happen: 30
